# texTract

With texTract you can easily extract text 🔍 from any image. This was a fun little project I made with Google's [Tesseract-OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) engine and PyQt5 for GUI. 

## Installation

Simply install the the executable, you don't need to install python ;) 

Make sure you have Tesseract installed, you can download the latest(v5.x.x) version from [here](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
